This app is made by Wilson and modified by an2ta for Tats library songs, sortable library, and other features . 

The music library stored to your localstorage, so it doesnt change even if you terminate the session (aka closing browser). However, I put expire time for 4 days (from the last session) in order to anticipate update in the library. Hence, u also need to delete the localstorage file if you did not see any changes if this repo is updated, kindly reminder that this repo will be grown ( I guess), so, the later mentioned about deleting the localstorage in ur machine, is required to have the current version.



In the project directory, you can run:

```
// 1. If you have not installed Yarn:
npm install yarn

// 2. Install the dependencies:
yarn install

// 3. Kick start the project in development mode:
yarn start
```

If you're ready to deploy the application to the internet, use:

```
yarn build
```

This will build the app for production to the "build" folder. The Built version will be optimized for best performance.
